  <h1>Welcoming Immigrants in Canada</h1>
  <p>A Civic Action Reflection Project</p>

<section>
  <h2>Project Goal</h2>
  <p>
      The goal of this project was to help immigrants feel accepted in the community, raise awareness about the challenges they face, and encourage people to be kind and welcoming toward newcomers.
      Immigration plays a major role in Canada’s growth and economy,
      and this project highlights the importance of providing immigrants with the resources they need to succeed.
  </p>

  <h2>The Issue</h2>
  <p>
    Many immigrants do not always feel accepted or supported when they arrive in Canada. Even though they contribute greatly to the economy,
    they often struggle due to a lack of resources, recognition of qualifications, and social support.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Actions Taken</h2>
  <p>
    To address this issue, I created a website to raise awareness and collect opinions from others.
    This allowed me to hear different perspectives and encouraged visitors to think more deeply about how they treat and support newcomers in their community.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The project successfully raised awareness about immigration and encouraged people to be more welcoming. 
    The feedback I received showed that people were thinking more about the issue, which demonstrated that the project had a positive impact.
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges & Learning</h2>
  <p>
    Some challenges included finding reliable information, waiting for responses from organizations, and understanding the social and economic perspectives surrounding immigration. 
    Through this, I learned how important immigration is to Canada’s economy and how critical proper support systems are for immigrant success.

  <h2>Reflection & Future Action</h2>
  <p>
    This project helped me develop stronger research and communication skills. If I were to do this project again, I would start outreach earlier to gather more insights. 
    In the future, I plan to stay informed about immigration issues and help new students at school feel welcomed and supported.
