  <h1>Welcoming Immigrants in Canada</h1>
  <p>
    This website was created as part of a civic action project to raise awareness about
    immigration in Canada, explain the actions taken, and reflect on the results.
  </p>

  <h2>The Issue</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">What problem in the community does this project focus on?</p>
  <p>
    Many immigrants in Canada do not always feel accepted or fully supported when they
    arrive. Even though immigrants play a major role in Canada’s growth and economy,
    they often face challenges such as limited access to resources, difficulty getting
    their qualifications recognized, and feeling excluded from the community.
  </p>
  <p>
    This issue matters because without proper support and acceptance, immigrants may
    struggle to succeed, which affects not only them but also the overall strength of
    Canadian society.
  </p>

  <h2>The Action</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">What action was taken to address the issue?</p>
  <p>
    The main action taken for this project was creating this website. The purpose of
    the website is to raise awareness about immigration, encourage people to reflect
    on their attitudes toward newcomers, and provide a space for others to share their
    opinions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using a website as an action allowed the message to reach more people and made it
    easier for others to engage with the topic by reading, reflecting, and leaving
    comments.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The Results</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">What impact did the action have?</p>
  <p>
    The website helped raise awareness about the challenges immigrants face and
    encouraged people to think more carefully about how they treat newcomers in their
    community. The comments and feedback received showed that visitors were reflecting
    on the issue and reconsidering their views.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, this project had a positive impact by starting conversations and promoting
    kindness, understanding, and support for immigrants.

  <h2>Community Feedback</h2>
  <p><strong>Josh</strong>: This actually made me think more about immigration. I didn’t realize how hard it can be for people coming here even though they help our economy.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaliyah</strong>: I like how this project explains things in a simple way. It made me think about how we treat new students at school.</p>
  <p><strong>Ryan</strong>: I agree that just letting people into Canada isn’t enough. They need support or else it’s way harder for them to succeed.</p>
  <p><strong>Maria</strong>: This website changed my opinion a bit. I didn’t know immigrants face so many challenges after moving here.</p>
